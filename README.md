# Stolpersteine App - Android

This is the README file for the Stolpersteine, which aims to provide a platform for users to explore and honor the memory of victims through various features.

## Features

### Map

The app includes an interactive map where users can view their own location as well as all Stolpersteine markers. Users can search for victims by name or location/address on the map.

### AI Storytelling

The app utilizes the OpenAI API to enhance storytelling. It takes the victim's story from the database and paraphrases it in the first person, creating the illusion that the victim is telling their own story. Additionally, there is an option to play the story with an AI-generated voice that matches the victim's characteristics (e.g., gender).

### Personalization

Users can save the most impactful stories within the app for future reference. They can also keep track of the Stolpersteine they have personally visited.

### Virtual Candles

Users have the option to virtually "light a candle" in honor of a victim. This feature aims to recreate the act of lighting a candle in a church or ceremony. The candle will be graphically illustrated and will be lit once clicked.

### Notifications(in feature)

The app will provide location-based notifications to users when they are in proximity to a Stolpersteine marker. This feature ensures that users never miss an opportunity to learn about and commemorate a victim.

### Smartwatch Connection(in feature)

The app is partially compatible with smartwatches. This feature allows users to conveniently receive notifications or use GPS navigation to locate a Stolpersteine marker through their smartwatch.

### Stolpersteine of the Day

To highlight lesser-known Stolpersteine markers, the app features a "Stolpersteine of the Day" section on the home page. This section draws attention to a specific Stolpersteine marker each day, encouraging users to light a virtual candle and honor the memory of the victim.
